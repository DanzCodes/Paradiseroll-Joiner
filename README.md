<h1>Automatize Joiner for Paradiseroll</h1>
<p>Paradiseroll Joiner is an automation for the automatic entry of accounts in paradiseroll raids. Paradiseroll was a casino that allowed you to win money/robux through the exchange of Roblox items. It did a roll pull and closed the page. This is a small project that I did to demonstrate my skills in API reversing, web scraping, discord bot creation, web development, API creation, and other details. It is a fairly simple project that took me a week to do. It is not fully structured and has vulnerabilities.</p>
